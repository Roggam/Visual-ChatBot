VISUAL CHATBOT

A visual chatbot is an application that is able to interpret images shared in real time and respond to questions about the visual content through voice recognition. Information that the client may not know themselves, such as the make and model of their product, could easily be determined by a visual chatbot with access to a vast database of images and information to compare it to. 

For Example, when the user opens the app and ask the chatbot about the item in front of camera, the chatbot recognizes the images, translates images to texts and translates text to speech and then formulates a reply and provides it to the user in the form of speech. User can ask more question about the item like usage, expiration, etc.
